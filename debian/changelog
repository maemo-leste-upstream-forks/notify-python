  [ Scott Kitterman ]

    attach_to_status_icon() are missing.

  * Add /svn to the Vcs-Svn URL to allow copy-paste in svn+ssh:// URLs. :-P
  * Depends on ${misc:Depends}.
  * Fix usage of spaces versus tab in rules; the fix for #434714 was in place,
    but had a syntax error; thanks Martin Pitt; closes: #434714.

    closes: #440244.
